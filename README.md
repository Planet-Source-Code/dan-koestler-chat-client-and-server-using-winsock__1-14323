### Description

This easy to follow code shows a way to connect two computers, using winsock and IP addresses, and send messages back and fourth. It has 'headers' or names that appear before the text and every single line of code is commented! Great for beginners who want to know how to easily connect!
 
### More Info
 
You need the local and remote computer ports (you set them yourself, just make sure they are the same) and the remote ip address. Then you can send messages back and fourth.

The program can send messages between to computers.

Learning about Winsock very easily.
